     <h2>Jeremy Ginter Introduction:</h2>
     <p class=intro>
       <span class=sentence>My name is Jeremy Ginter. </span>I was born in Portland Oregon, and have lived in the Pacific Northwest my entire life. I am 23 years old.
     </p>
    
     <p>
       I am currently working at Home Depot, and have worked here for 2.5 years. In my free time, I like to go hiking or mountain biking. When the weather is too cold or rainy to do this, I enjoy going bowling, or playing video games with friends. 
     </p>
   
     <p>
       My family includes my Father, Mother, and Younger Sister. I currently live alone with my dog Whitney. She is an Australian Shepherd, and is 8 years old.
